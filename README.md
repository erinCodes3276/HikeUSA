# HikeUSA
Hike USA is a recommendation system that suggests hiking trails and campsites in New York State based on user-selected coordinates on an interactive map. It utilizes K-means clustering to group similar locations together and provide personalized recommendations. Integrated with the Google Maps API, users can explore different areas and receive tailored suggestions for their outdoor adventures.

-Technical Challenges-

Data Preprocessing: 
  Preparing the data for clustering can be a complex and time-consuming task. It involves cleaning and formatting the dataset, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a suitable format for clustering algorithms.
    
Feature Selection:
  Choosing the right features for clustering can significantly impact the quality of the recommendations. Identifying the most relevant features from the dataset requires careful analysis and domain knowledge. It was tempting to use everything in the dataset but every feature adds new layers of complexity.
    
Interactive Map Integration: 
  Integrating the Google Maps API and enabling user interaction with the map adds an extra layer of complexity to the project. Handling user input and converting it into usable coordinates for clustering requires robust implementation.


-What have you learned?-

Data Preprocessing: 
  I have learned various techniques and approaches to handle data preprocessing tasks, such as cleaning, formatting, and transforming data. Dealing with missing values and selecting appropriate features are crucial steps in preparing the data for clustering algorithms.

K-means Clustering: 
  I have developed a solid understanding of the K-means clustering algorithm and its application in recommendation systems. I have learned how to optimize and evaluate the performance of the clustering model using metrics like the silhouette score.

API Integration: 
  Integrating external APIs, such as the Google Maps API, can enhance the functionality of the application and provide a better user experience. I have learned how to handle user interaction with the map, convert user input into coordinates, and utilize the API's features effectively.

User-Centric Design: 
  Designing user interfaces that are intuitive, user-friendly, and visually appealing is crucial for engaging users. I have gained insights into user-centric design principles and the importance of incorporating user feedback in improving the system. I also learnt that simplicity is often key to creating a more seamless user experience.
